        <h2>Why I Joined the Program</h2>
        <p>
          I've been interested in coding since about 2021, but I struggled with
          consistency and the drive to keep learning. I joined the Alt School
          program to as a means to gain hands-on experience and develop
          industry-relevant skills in front end engineering. I believe this
          program offers a unique platform to learn from experts and collaborate
          with like-minded peers who can motivate and push me towards my goals.
          I was also moved to join because of its virtual nature, allowing me to
          combine learning with other demanding aspects of my life.
